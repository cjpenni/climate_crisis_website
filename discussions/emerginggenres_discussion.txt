     From my analysis of the top 200 worldwide box office films from the years 2024 and 2023, I have found two emerging genres.
     The first I call "Spiritual Exploration". This genre highlights both a search for and a critique of religion. Films in this genre feature characters on a journey to discover their own beliefs or connect with a particular religion. These films also explore the limitations/contradictions within religions. The emergence of this genre is likely due to the societal shift away from organized religion and the self-discovery and fear that goes along with that shift. I also feel this genre has a strong connection with climate crisis films, particularly dystopian futures in which characters have little, both materially and to live for, other than their beliefs. This also plays a large role in how characters and real people view the climate crisis and what a post-apocalyptic world would hold for them.
     The second genre I call "Systemic Scrutiny". This genre focuses on critically examining the power structures and institutions that create social injustice. These films often depict characters fighting against these systems, exposing their flaws, and advocating for change. I do not think this is necessarily a new genre, but I do think it is gaining more popularity than it had in the previous year, and perhaps a re-emergence. I think this is likely as a result of rising political tensions due to upcoming elections as well as just general recognition of how much governments and corporations are destroying the planet. This genre has a strong connection with many dystopian climate crisis films due to the large corporations and government entities that are destroying the planet and creating more social injustices.
